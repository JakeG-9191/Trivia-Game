# Trivia-Game
JavaScript Based Trivia Game 

# Object
This game provides the user with a set of questions, each with four possible answers, three of which are incorrect. Once the user begins the game, they will have a set amount of time to answer the questions. All "right" and "wrong" answers will be recorded and will be displayed at the end of the game, either once enough choices have been recognized compared to the amount of questions or once the user runs out of time.

At the end of the game, the amount of right and wrong guesses for the trivia will be displayed, and the user will have the option to play again, which will restart the game and update the timer accordingly.

# Known Bugs
Major Bug - user only allowed to select 10 answers, meaning that they are confined to one choice per question, and can even select one answer 10 times in one question, stopping the game before the intended time.

Minor Bug - options are highlighted in red when they are selected but fail to stay that color, making it challenging for the user to know exactly what answer they chose.
